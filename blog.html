				My Learning Highlights of the Subject
			</h1>
			<p>
				Web development is the aspect of the curriculum that I 
				find most interesting. I can hone my abilities on this 
				practical playground that is provided by these classes. 
				In addition to letting my creativity run wild, developing 
				websites exposes me to problems in the real world that 
				need to be solved. Even with the sporadic setbacks, every 
				initiative seems like a step toward betterment. 
				In my "Introduction to Computing" journey, I find the most 
				enjoyment in the practical applications of web development 
				because they not only make studying fun but also greatly 
				expand my skill set and comprehension of the subject.
			</p>
			<p>
				I thoroughly enjoy delving into the realm of human-computer 
				interaction (HCI) and discovering its multifaceted dimensions. 
				Exploring the intricate interplay between humans and technology 
				has not only broadened my understanding of user experiences but 
				has also illuminated the significance of designing interfaces 
				that seamlessly integrate with human behavior and preferences. 
				Unraveling the principles of HCI has given me valuable insights 
				into creating more intuitive and user-friendly digital environments, 
				fostering a profound appreciation for the dynamic synergy between 
				users and the technologies they engage with.
